# SHAU_GL
Work in progress, third iteration of my SHAUSTUFF website using React and Bootstrap. It also serves as a WebGL development framework for me. It's built using webpack allowing for quick local deployments. To run this locally install node and then:

navigate from the root directory to /src/main/js/static and extract bugatti.obj from bugatti.obj.gz.

gunzip bugatti.obj.gz

...then from the project root directory:

npm install

webpack-dev-server

then open a web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:8080
