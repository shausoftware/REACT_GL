# SHAU_GL
Work in progress, third iteration of my SHAUSTUFF website using React and Bootstrap. It also serves as a WebGL development framework for me. It's built using webpack allowing for quick local deployments. To run this locally install node and from the project root run:

webpack-dev-server

then open a web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:8080
